Hello! I am your customizeable Steam sales tracker!
Use me to add games to your server's wishlist and I will let you know when they go on sale so the lads, and lassies never miss a deal ðŸ˜Ž.

Here are some prompts for you to use:
add "game" - will add this game to the wishlist and I will begin tracking it. (full game name must be writtin in quotations)
delete "game" - will delete this game from the wishlist and I will no longer track it. (full game name must be written in quotations)
games - will show you the list of games I am tracking and if they are on sale.
sales - will show you all the games currently on sale from your wishlist.

Every Friday I will be posting a message with games from your wishlist that are on sale.
Every day that a new game from your wishlist goes on sale, I will let you know.

That's pretty much it, if you have questions message <@375852152544952322> or <@650136117227683877>.

Love you
